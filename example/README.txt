The initial example.css file is untouched by this plugin - and as a result doesn not render correctly for example.html

When this plugin is enabled open example.css and simply save the file, and the css will be "compiled" down implementing variables and nesting within the styles.

You may wish to have a play around with the plugin settings to see what is going on behind the scenes.
